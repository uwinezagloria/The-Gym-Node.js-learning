# mental model practical question
You are tasked with creating a basic Node.js server using Express. The server should allow you to perform basic **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on a collection of items stored in a file (`data.json`). You are required to implement the following endpoints:

1. **GET Request**: Fetch all items from the `data.json` file and return them as a response.
2. **POST Request**: Create a new item by sending data in the request body and appending it to the list of items in `data.json`. Each item should have an `id` field, which should be unique.
3. **PUT Request**: Update an existing item by specifying its `id` in the URL and sending the updated data in the request body.
4. **DELETE Request**: Delete an item by specifying its `id` in the URL, and remove it from `data.json`.

You are free to implement the file operations (reading, writing, and updating) using the standard Node.js `fs` (File System) module. If the file doesn't exist, create it as part of the process.

**Requirements:**

- Create a server using Express.
- Implement CRUD operations as described above.
- Use the `fs` module to handle reading, writing, updating, and deleting from the `data.json` file.
- Ensure each item in `data.json` has a unique `id` (you can generate the id using UUID or by incrementing a counter).
- Return appropriate status codes (200, 201, 404, etc.) based on the outcome of the operations.
