# question 1
You are tasked with creating a basic Node.js server using the http module. The server should be capable of handling two types of requests:

GET Request: When a user sends a GET request to the server, the server should read the contents of a file named input.txt located in the same directory as your server script and send its contents as the response.
POST Request: When a user sends a POST request to the server with data in the body, the server should write that data into a file named output.txt in the same directory.

You can choose to implement the file operations (reading and writing) either using the standard Node.js fs (File System) module or by using streams for handling large files more efficiently.

Requirements:

Create a server using the http module.
Handle GET and POST requests as described.
Use the fs module to read from and write to files.
Implement the functionality using streams if you want to handle large files more efficiently.

Bonus:

Ensure that the server returns appropriate status codes and error messages in case of any file operation failures.
