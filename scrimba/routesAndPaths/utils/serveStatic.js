import path from "node:path"

/*
Challenge 2:

1. Create and export a function called 'serveStatic'. 
   It should take in the base directory as a parameter.

2. Build a path to index.html in the 'public' folder and save it to a const 'filePath'. 
   (Which node module will you need to import to do this? Which method joins the path together?)

3. Log 'filePath' to the console.

export const serveStatic=(dir)=>{
const filePath=path.join(dir,"public","index.html")
console.log(filePath)
